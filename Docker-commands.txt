docker engine
?	deamon
?	containerd
?	runc

runc 

As	previously	mentioned,	runc	is	the	reference	implementation	of	the	OCI container-runtime-spec.	Docker,	Inc.	was	heavily	involved	in	defining	the	spec and	developing	runc. 

containerd
 In	order	to	use	runc,	the	Docker	engine	needed	something	to	act	as	a	bridge between	the	daemon	and	runc.	

We	mentioned	earlier	that	containerd	uses	runc	to	create	new	containers.
